      <h2 id='mean'>What the freedom of assembly means</h2>
      <p>The Freedom of Assembly defends the right to peacefully meet with anyone. It also allows people to use crowds to spread messages. The freedom lets anyone to meet and talk about any topic without worrying about getting in trouble.</p>
      <p>However, it doesn't allow people to assemble if the meeting will hurt other people, cause chaos, or take advantage of violence. Permits are required to protest so protesters and people being protested against can stay safe and civilians have enough space.</p>
      <h2 id='hist'>The origins of the first amendment</h2>
      <p>The first amendment was written in 1789 and ratified into law in 1791, proposed by James Madison. It was made to prevent a national religion, allow criticizing the government, and have more open debates. The framers didn't highlight the basic freedoms in the Constitution, thinking it was unnecessary.</p>

      <p>Dirk De Jonge held a meeting in Portland, Oregon that was sponsored by a Community party. The police raided his meeting and arrested him for violating Oregon's anti-Communist laws. De Jonge lost.</p>
