    <h2 class="glow">Other name things</h2>
    <p class="content">My name means nothing to me, and it holds no cultural significance.</p>
    <p class="content">My parents named me after a character in <em>The Sixth Sense</em>; I haven’t watched the movie yet though. They realized my name was hard for native Chinese speakers to pronounce, so they chose an easier one for my brother.</p>
    <p class="content">I like my name because it’s short and monosyllabic, but perhaps it could be shorter and more intuitive to spell (eg San, Sa, S?), but then it’ll look too Chinese and affect some people’s initial perceptions before meeting me. I prefer Irish spelling because it’s shorter.</p>

      <button class="def-arrow" id="right"></button>
      <div class="definition def-1 showing">
        <h3 class="def-by glow">Ethnically</h3>
        <p class="content">I would call myself Taiwanese and more generally Asian but distinctively not Chinese because their government makes them undesirable. I also identify as Californian but not American for similar reasons.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="definition def-2">
        <h3 class="def-by glow">Zodiac</h3>
        <p class="content">Conveniently, my Western and Chinese zodiacs are both sheep. I like sheep because they're cute, fluffy, and recognizable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="definition def-3">
        <h3 class="def-by glow">Age</h3>
        <p class="content">2003-04-09 is an acceptable date to be born on because it all has single digits, but this makes writing it ambiguous (4/9 is either April 9 or September 4). Being the oldest sibling is acceptable because I get to get through school before they make it worse: I narrowly avoided CAASPP testing in fifth grade and I nearly was able to avoid the SELF program and have Dunbar in Gunn. However, it means my parents use me as a test subject for my younger brother.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="definition def-4">
        <h3 class="def-by glow">Interests</h3>
        <p class="content">I can develop for the front end of websites and make pretty cool web apps and games like Gunn Student Simulator, OlamREEE, and UGWA. I’m also interested in conlangs and linguistics.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="glow">Success story</h2>
    <p class="content">So far, Gunn Student Simulator has been pretty successful; surprisingly, even some Paly students have heard of it. The game would get a “success” score on my popularity-based rubric.</p>
