# OpenShit to-do

- properly keep keys in place when left side is trimmed
- fix the layers not stretching all the way
- if source/text button clicked, allow them to drag out a region in the track thing maybe
- scroll to playhead when using arrows if out of view
- load fonts from Google Fonts
- rearrange layers
- right click on layer > move up, move down, insert above, insert below, delete
- right click on track > split (ctrl + X), duplicate, delete
- snap to loop borders
- ~~changing ease function should change it for all selected keys~~
- ~~snap to playhead as well?~~
- ~~let user paste in their own cubic-bezier~~
- ~~rearrange menubar~~
- ~~help menu~~
- ~~set video width/height/frame rate?/bitrate/export format~~
- ~~resize panels~~
- ~~right click on source > download?, remove~~
- ~~icon for elastic and bounce easing functions~~
- ~~right click on time markers > go to...~~

## Other possibilities

- support canvas filters
- sound effects? or at least gain for volume > 100%
- integrate audio editor
- autosave using cache (might be a bad idea)
