# OpenShit to-do

- properly keep keys in place when left side is trimmed
- let user paste in their own cubic-bezier
- fix the layers not stretching all the way
- make it more clear that one should drag from a source/the text button
- scroll to playhead when using arrows if out of view
- load fonts from Google Fonts
- rearrange layers
- right click on source > download?, remove
- right click on time markers > go to...
- right click on layer > delete
- right click on track > split (ctrl + X), duplicate, delete
- set video width/height/frame rate?/bitrate/export format
- help menu
- rearrange menubar:
  - File
    - Open
    - Save
    - Video settings
    - Export
  - Help
    - How to use
    - Keyboard shortcuts
    - About
- snap to loop borders
- snap to playhead as well?
- icon for elastic and bounce easing functions

## Other possibilities

- support canvas filters
- sound effects? or at least gain for volume > 100%
- integrate audio editor
- autosave using cache (might be a bad idea)
