          <p>I attest to the following: I shall not give or revive aid during this exam. My answers will be entirely my own. Plagiarism software will scan my responses. My teacher will receive my responses.</p>
          <p>If I give or receive help or submit work that is not my own: My score will be canceled. My attempt to cheat will be reported to college admissions offices and my high school. I will be banned from future College Board exams. Anyone who helps me or receives help from me will be investigated.</p>
          <p>My grandfather picks up quartz and valuable onyx jewels. Send 60 dozen quart jars and 12 black pans.</p>
          <p>When I was young I hung out with some jerks that I called friends. They bullied me a lot and were just assholes. I made this server out of rage when I got banned from their server, and in the long run this server was more successful than theirs. The "No Nickname" rule was put in place because the jerks over on that server would bully me and change my name to racist and offensive names. But I had no other friends back then... So out of a fit of rage I created this server and swore to treat everyone on it the same, fair way. And in the end I succeeded more in every possible way than those bullies.</p>
