          <p>The following files were found in an abandoned office building in Ovine Loc 87. One of the cleanup crew found a thumb drive on a desk during their preliminary inspections prior to the building‚Äôs demolition.</p>
          <p>The archive was collectively called ‚Äú<em>p</em>Apers foun""‚Äúd',‚Äù according to a text file stored alongside the archive. The stories in the file were reportedly discovered by a sheep rummaging through a cabinet‚Äîthe specific methods were not made clear‚Äîand then entered into the database of the company that owned the building. Evidently, the sheep accountant had difficulties using the human English keyboard, resulting in the odd formatting and characters.</p>
          <p>The crew sent the flash drive to the local library, who forwarded it to the Official Governing Group of Ovine Loc 87. Despite the stories being written in English, the local government posted an announcement in Ovinish on the Ovine Loc‚Äôs public bulletin wall asking for their author. Reasonably, the government received no response within three business days, so the works were put into the public domain in hopes that their author could be identified by other beings in the world.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, due to strict guidelines set by the Department of Ovine English Terms, because the archive itself is considered an ovine work, its name must preserve its casing, spelling, specific Unicode codepoints, and bold/italic formatting. Thus, this site will aim to respect these terms and hopes others will too. Please note that the first two quotation marks and the apostrophe are ambidextrous, while the third quotation mark is an opening/left double quotation mark.</p>

            Preferred form of address: Commander Lark
          </p>
          <p class="space-around">Mr. Lark comes from a wealthy family of yacht sellers who has notably always tried to side with the current leaders in politics<sup>[1]</sup> which has allowed them to stay unprosecuted throughout the People‚Äôs Republic of Northeast Narnia‚Äôs ever-changing politics. He now serves his family by also selling yachts. During his free time, he is often observed reclining on his lounge chair out on the deck of his personal yacht, reading the latest issue of the <em>National People‚Äôs Times</em>, and drinking from a cup of grape soda kept full by his servants.</p>

          <h3>Opposition Party On The Rise</h3>
          <p class="no-indent"><strong class="small-caps">NEW PEOPLE‚ÄôS CITY</strong> ‚Äî The People‚Äôs Democratic Party (PDP), a minority political party in our national government, continues to rapidly gain widespread support throughout Northeast Narnia, especially in the barbaric southern regions. The PDP is currently the largest opposition party to the People‚Äôs Free Party (PFP) and is under the strong financial influence of a family of immigrants from East Narnia. The family, headed by Leuf Munkler, profits from cruise sales internationally, including East Narnia, the Northeastern Narnian Islands, and recently the People‚Äôs Republic of Northeast Narnia. The PDP has recently been promoting its advertising campaign throughout the nation, but they have made multiple false claims about the government which our federal agencies have recently disproved. Our independent newspaper would like to remind our readers, whom we know to be intelligent and informed citizens, to doubt and distrust false rumours about the PDP, and notify local law enforcement of people involved in this disinformation movement. Indeed, photos have been taken of misinformed citizens from southern cities entering complimentary cruise ship rides offered by the PDP as part of their campaign. <strong class="small-caps">CONTINUED ON PAGE 10</strong></p>

          <p>The daily polls yesterday have shown a 10% jump in support for the Democratic Party, and it is still increasing rapidly as I write. A rival political party only brings political instability, economic failure for the country, a threat to our family and the country‚Äôs safety, and a risk to our company‚Äôs profits.

            <h3>VICTORY AGAINST EAST NARNIA ‚Äî <em>THE INDEPENDENT TIMES</em></h3>
            <h4 class="independent-times-subtitle"><em>THE INDEPENDENT TIMES</em> IS A SUBSIDIARY OF THE LARK FAMILY YACHT COMPANY</h4>
          </hgroup>
          <p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">ARG. 34, 283</span> ‚Äî Fitted appropriately for the occasion, the great Commander Lark stood proudly last night on the bow end of his newly repurposed ship, <em>The People‚Äôs Yacht</em>. To either side, weaponized yachts followed behind him forming a V shape. Ahead, they had spotted a lone cruise ship drifting in the ocean waters with its bright yellow lights inside shining out of its windows like a frozen explosion of sparks. All lights on board the yachts had been strategically turned off to blend in with the darkness of the cloudy night.</p>
          <p>With a short red signalling flare on the aft end of <em>The People‚Äôs Yacht</em>, the lateral yachts broke off from their V formation, silently cutting through the water, circling around the cruise ship. After Commander Lark felt comfortable with their arrangement, he yanked out his speaker horn from his holster. Everyone on board his yacht instinctively covered their ears when they saw this, and as Commander Lark began speaking, the sound blast was reportedly indistinguishable from an earthquake.</p>
          <p>‚ÄúMay I have your attention, please! May I have your attention, please!‚Äù he shrieked into the microphone. ‚ÄúYour nautical vehicle has been deemed suspicious by the government of the People‚Äôs Republic of Northeast Narnia‚Äîafter all, you can‚Äôt call yourself a man without a yacht. Please remain calm and do not resist as we tow your ship to shore to detain you indefinitely.‚Äù</p>
          <p>The ship feebly resisted. Spotting a large enough gap between the yachts, the ship suddenly accelerated at an unprecedented rate, drenching the yachts in seawater as it spun around. The commotion on board was chaotic, even from afar: passengers on board screamed and crashed into each other and furniture. Plates shattered on the floor as the ship started tilting at a steeper angle.</p>
          <p>However, the yachts were faster. <em>The People‚Äôs Yacht</em> shot a torpedo at the rudders of the ship while the other yachts moved in front of and around the ship, preventing its escape. To assert dominance, <em>The People‚Äôs Yacht</em> also fired into the ship‚Äôs windows with its machine gun. Commander Lark himself complemented this by lifting his arms, forming right angles with his body. Finally, a large white flag was hastily flung over the railing on one side, indicating their surrender. The soldiers in the yachts cheered, and they victoriously led the captured cruise ship towards the ports of New Aldenbreau.</p>

          <p class="letter-date">Argos 34, 283</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-after">Dear Mr. Leuf Munkler,</p>
          <p>I am writing to you now from the Holinois Prison in New Aldenbreau, Northeast Narnia, less than three kilometres from the East Narnian border. I sit before a large window facing the Northeast Narnian coast where our cruise ship now lies under the control of the Northeast Narnian authorities after an unfortunate turn of events the night before.</p>
          <p>Our ship had been cruising safely, more than several kilometres from the disputed waters between our country and Northeast Narnia. At least that was what we believed, for we were soon intercepted by the Northeast Narnian Navy armed with missiles and guns. We were forced to surrender, and upon docking, we were all promptly detained. One of their generals told us of their intent to convert our cruise into a yacht. It seems that this is not an isolated incident either; several other East Narnian cruise ships are lined up covered in construction scaffolding along the dock. There‚Äôs a stream of people being forced out of one as I write.</p>
          <p>I request that you investigate this sudden act of aggression and seek to somehow have our cruises returned.</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-before">

          <p class="space-around">The Munkler Family Cruise Ships Company had sued the Lark Family Yacht Company on the thirty-fifth day of Argose‚Äôs Cycle, year 283, and the case was raised to the national courts on the thirty-sixth day of that Cycle.</p>

            Date: Thirty-seventh day of Argose‚Äôs Cycle, year 283
          </p>
          <p>The hearing begins with the People‚Äôs Just Gong being hit, a custom in many Northeastern Narnian cultures. As the loud ring fades, the three People‚Äôs Supreme Court Justices of Northeast Narnia march into the courtroom in a single file towards their assigned seats. Synchronously, they all face the large portrait of the People‚Äôs President George Erningstein at the opposite end of the room and salute. The two side Justices sit down while the Chief Justice in the middle remains standing.</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-around">GO: Today, on the thirty-seventh day of Argose‚Äôs Cycle, year 283, we present the case between the Munkler Family Cruise Ships Company, represented by Leuf Munkler, and the Lark Family Yacht Company, represented by Corusent Lark. Per Article 6 of the People‚Äôs National Constitution, all people and companies are guaranteed the right to a free trial. As is the norm, we will let the plaintiff present their case for sixty seconds, and then we will allow the defendant to speak for sixty seconds. Afterwards, we will present our decision within 24 hours.</p>
          <p>The Chief Justice sits down, and a buzzer rings with a green light lighting up in front of the plaintiffs‚Äô section of the room, indicating that it is their turn to speak. Leuf Munkler, president of the Munkler Family Cruise Ships Company, steps on the podium to the microphone. He is dressed formally in a tie and has messy grey hair and a large bushy mustache framing his face. He speaks slowly and awkwardly in his thick East Narnian accent.</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-around">MUNKLER: We believe that the unsolicited capture of our products is a clear instance of theft and should not be tolerated. We also believe that the unauthorized modification of our products is in violation of anti-tampering laws in your country. And, it should be obvious to you his unethical intentions: his eyes are red and black, the colours of evil!</p>
          <p>The buzzer sounds, marking the end of his allotted sixty-second interval. Mr. Munkler sighs and leaves the podium. The buzzer then sounds in front of Commander Lark.</p>
          <p>Commander Lark begins by facing the portrait of President Erningstein and saluting, holding his salute for a full ten seconds, during which the Justices nod, impressed. He scratches his head, surrounding himself in a cloud of dandruff.</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-around">LARK: You can‚Äôt call yourself a man without a yacht.</p>
          <p>He smiles at the Justices, and they nodded back. He returns to his seat. ADDENDUM FROM MOU. 5, 284: Later investigations reveal he knew that the Justices, as members elected by the PFP and paid by his family‚Äôs company, had already sided with him.</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-around">HELEON: Is that all, Mr. Lark?</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-around">LARK: Yes.</p>
          <p>The Justices stand up together and file out of the room.</p>
          <p>Seemingly preparing for a long wait, shuffling and murmurs can be heard on the other side of the room as they pull out their entertainment devices and blankets to sleep on. However, almost as soon as the Justices have left, the Justices begin to file back in.</p>
          <p>The People‚Äôs Just Gong is hit once more, and Justices salute the portrait of President Erningstein.</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-around">GO: The People‚Äôs Supreme Court has determined that the defendant‚Äôs actions have not been unlawful. The plaintiff will be fined fifteen thousand pounds for court fees. Case dismissed.</p>
          <p>An uproar immediately arises from the plaintiff‚Äôs side of the courtroom, but they are immediately silenced by guards and led out of the room. Chief Justice Go is seen approaching Commander Lark personally but forgets to mute his microphone.</p>
          <p class="no-indent space-around">GO: We will expect extra payment for this decision.</p>
          <p>Commander Lark shrugs and makes an inaudible remark before leaving the room.</p>

          <h3>New Legislation Promoting Domestic Products</h3>
          <p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">NEW PEOPLE‚ÄôS CITY</span> ‚Äî On the second day of Mounion‚Äôs Cycle, only a few hours after the Mounion‚Äôs Cycle celebrations, the People‚Äôs National Democratic Representative Legislature convened and unanimously passed Proposition 783. The bill chiefly prohibits the purchase of foreign products such as cruise ships, but it also announces lowered yacht fares to attract more passengers for intercity yacht rides. In addition, heavy tariffs have been placed on most East Narnia imports to support local industries. <span class="small-caps">CONTINUED ON PAGE 34</span></p>
          <hr class="snippet-divider">
          <p>Commander Lark sat comfortably in his air-conditioned office, sipping from a celebratory cup of grape soda. Opposite him, a large board was affixed to the wall with his favourite catchphrase written in traditional Northeast Narnian script by a professional calligrapher: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt call yourself a man without a yacht.‚Äù Outside, his nephews screamed as they played and splashed around in his on-deck pool; their parents were in a company meeting downstairs.</p>
          <p>Lark twirled a pen around in his fingers, contemplating his recent successes against the PDP. About a dozen dropped pens littered the ground beside him. Of course, he believed all his acts were undoubtedly justifiable; his father, with his infinite wisdom, had told him to always treat himself first, for as a member of the hardworking Lark family, he deserved the respect and higher treatment.</p>
          <p>Someone else was in his yacht, but Lark was completely oblivious to it. The hallway was surprisingly empty and unguarded. As Commander Lark rested his head on the back of his chair and closed his eyes, dropping his final pen, the door opened slowly and soundlessly, and someone slipped inside. As he thought, a doubt started forming in his mind about his recent actions.</p>
          <p>Suddenly, it hit him.</p>

          <p>The pursuer was another businessman, similarly in formal attire: he wore a grey fedora and had sunglasses over his eyes. However, his skin was inhumanly yellow, his arms hung limp on his sides, and he was suspended a metre into the air, casting a shadow underneath him. Levitating facilitated the chase: he could simply glide over the puddles from last night‚Äôs rain, and he could effortlessly rise above traffic while Istinipheous hastily dodged cars, edging near death every second.</p>
          <p>None of the bystanders around Istinipheous bothered to help him. It would be poor judgement to attempt to aid one‚Äôs escape from a floating businessman, and no one wanted to be publicly shamed for being a criminal accomplice since earlier that day, carrying suitcases had been declared illegal.</p>
          <p>Of course, Istinipheous could easily render the chase unnecessary by dropping his suitcase. However, he held a certain affection towards his suitcase, as it had once been one of his prized possessions, and he didn‚Äôt want to risk losing it again.</p>
          <p>Despite the heated situation, he remained calm and clear-headed. He frequently glanced back, eying the businessman. Running under an overpass, he saw the being behind him drifting over it instead. A hypothesis began forming in his head.</p>
          <p>As a former taxi driver, he knew the location of a nearby tunnel that allowed pedestrians across the busy street above it. He entered it, and glancing back, the floating businessman was nowhere to be seen.</p>
          <p>The walls had been echoing happy chattering about the latest legalizations by the city‚Äîred paint, ice cream, and taxis‚Äîbut it died away as Istinipheous stopped inside to catch his breath, casting cursory glances around him at the other passersby, who watched him wide-eyed as he examined his suitcase. Ever since the floating businessmen began toying with the city and its legal structure, people had to rely on gossip to stay up to date with the law. Nonetheless, Istinipheous‚Äôs deception seemed to have worked: the businessman hovered above the street, waiting for Istinipheous to leave. His spot was temporary‚Äîthe police would come for him soon‚Äîbut he had time to spare, so he took a quick lunch break and brainstormed an ideal stopping point from his mental map of the city.</p>
          <p>With his pineapple and ham sandwich consumed, he took off back towards the end where he entered. Now, the tunnel was eerily devoid of people; the only sound was his heavy breathing ricocheting off the walls and the roar of the vehicles above. He wasn‚Äôt sure if the floating businessman would supernaturally know his location, but when he came out, he saw the floating businessman floating by the other end of the tunnel. He was a few steps ahead, albeit not by much, for the businessman immediately sensed his exit and resumed his chase.</p>
          <p>With a route memorized, he slipped by pedestrians and cars as he ran across sidewalks and streets. He kept a constant watch on the levitating businessman, who popped in and out in the crowd.</p>
          <p>His destination was within view: an abandoned parking garage, sporting 27 floors of parking space. Despite its disuse, it was well maintained and thus well guarded. Nonetheless, Istinipheous immediately identified a side entrance: the emergency fire exit staircases scaling up the wall. In the final stretch, he could see that the guards were actively patrolling the main entrance, but the stairs were largely neglected. Upon reaching the stairs, he leaped upwards, grasping the bars of the stairs, and pulled himself up onto the second floor. The levitating businessman quickly followed and zoomed to the top of the parking garage, hopelessly awaiting Istinipheous‚Äôs exit above.</p>
          <p>Now relatively safe in the empty parking space, he placed his suitcase on the ground and stepped back. In an instant, the suitcase vanished, and in its place was Istinipheous‚Äôs beloved taxi, returning from the days of freedom in the past. With tremendous emotion, he hopped in the driver‚Äôs seat, seeing again the photos of his wife and children. Now that taxis were legal again, he was now free to drive away from the cursed city and back to where he hoped his family would be, still waiting for him.</p>
