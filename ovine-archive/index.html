          <p>The following files were found in an abandoned office building in Ovine Loc 87. One of the cleanup crew found a thumb drive on a desk during their preliminary inspections prior to the building‚Äôs demolition.</p>
          <p>The archive was collectively called ‚Äú<em>p</em>Apers foun""‚Äúd',‚Äù according to a text file stored alongside the archive. The stories in the file were reportedly discovered by a sheep rummaging through a cabinet‚Äîthe specific methods were not made clear‚Äîand then entered into the database of the company that owned the building. Evidently, the sheep accountant had difficulties using the human English keyboard, resulting in the odd formatting and characters.</p>
          <p>The crew sent the flash drive to the local library, who forwarded it to the Official Governing Group of Ovine Loc 87. Despite the stories being written in English, the local government posted an announcement in Ovinish on the Ovine Loc‚Äôs public bulletin wall asking for their author. Reasonably, the government received no response within three business days, so the works were put into the public domain in hopes that their author could be identified by other beings in the world.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, due to strict guidelines set by the Department of Ovine English Terms, because the archive itself is considered an ovine work, its name must preserve its casing, spelling, specific Unicode codepoints, and bold/italic formatting. Thus, this site will aim to respect these terms and hopes others will too. Please note that the first two quotation marks and the apostrophe are ambidextrous, while the third quotation mark is an opening/left double quotation mark.</p>

          <p>I attest to the following: I shall not give or receive aid during this exam. My answers will be entirely my own. Plagiarism software will scan my responses. My teacher will receive my responses.</p>
          <p>If I give or receive help or submit work that is not my own: My score will be canceled. My attempt to cheat will be reported to college admissions offices and my high school. I will be banned from future College Board exams. Anyone who helps me or receives help from me will be investigated.</p>
          <p>My grandfather picks up quartz and valuable onyx jewels. Send 60 dozen quart jars and 12 black pans.</p>
          <p>When I was young I hung out with some jerks that I called friends. They bullied me a lot and were just assholes. I made this server out of rage when I got banned from their server, and in the long run this server was more successful than theirs. The "No Nickname" rule was put in place because the jerks over on that server would bully me and change my name to racist and offensive names. But I had no other friends back then... So out of a fit of rage I created this server and swore to treat everyone on it the same, fair way. And in the end I succeeded more in every possible way than those bullies.</p>
