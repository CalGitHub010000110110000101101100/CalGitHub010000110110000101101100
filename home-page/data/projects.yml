    The most compelling use case for this is editing the duration of the video.
    Even if you don't add any movie data, many video players, like Discord's,
    will show whatever you set the duration to, at least until near the end of
    the video when it knows how long it really is. This way, you can create
    videos that seem to be days long without going over upload limits.

    I know that it works for mp4 files produced by OBS, but it doesn't work with
    all mp4 files, like the ones taken by my phone.

    Kaaba is my third attempt at rendering voxels. I made it after learning
    enough WebGPU to feel confident in rendering voxels.

    The chunk size was increased to 32 in each axis, and there is more than one
    chunk by default, with randomly placed blocks to test performance by adding
    more block faces. Compared to the previous WebGL version, this verison isn't
    as powerful: there's no block placing or breaking, and block faces aren't
    culled between chunks.

    This was mostly a demo on the GPU side. Uploading data to the GPU is slow,
    so I only uploaded block positions and used instanced rendering to create 6
    vertices per face (3 vertices for each triangle in the square). I also
    adjusted how pixels are grabbed from the block texture atlas to prevent
    atlas bleeding, where a strip of the next texture in the atlas shows on the
    edges of a block face; this was an issue in the WebGL version.

    I also added post-processing effects mostly for the fun of it, since this
    was mostly a GPU learning experience.
